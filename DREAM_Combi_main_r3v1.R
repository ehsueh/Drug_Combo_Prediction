# == DOCUMENTATION =========================================

# == PURPOSE ==
# Round 3 (version 2) of Subchallenge 1
# In addition to monotherapy data, tried adding the following feature for training NN model:
#    - pubchem data of drugs (9 cols)
#    - gex (after pca we have 83 cols)
#    - a little bit of pathway data from c6 file (2 cols)

# == RESULTS ==
# Cross Validation R2 for neural net: 0.03118222
# Cross Validation R2 for random forest: -0.03102165 
# Not sure what went wrong with the forest model. 
# Submission will only include net model predictions.
